# Bob

> Struggle to keep your Neovim versions in check? Bob provides an easy way to install and switch versions on any system!

Bob is a cross-platform and easy-to-use Neovim version manager, allowing for easy switching between versions right from the command line.

## üåü Showcase

<img src="./resources/tapes/demo.gif">

## üîî Notices

- **2022-10-29**: Moved bob's symbolic link and downloads folder on macos from `/Users/user/Library/Application Support` to `~/.local/share` please make sure to move all of your downloads to the new folder, run `bob use <your desired version>` and update your PATH
- **2023-02-13**: Bob has recently switched to using a proxy executable for running Neovim executables. To switch from the old method that Bob used, follow these steps:

    1. Remove the current Neovim path from your global $PATH environment variable.
    2. Delete the following directory:
        On Unix: `~/.local/share/neovim`
        On Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\neovim`

    Secondly the name of the downloads directory property in the configuration file has changed. Please refer to the updated list of properties for the new name.

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure you don't have Neovim already installed via other ways e.g. a package manager.

## üîß Installation

### Install from releases

1. Download `bob-{platform}-x86_64.zip`
2. Unzip it
3. Run it with `bob`

### Install from AUR

1. Install the [`bob`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bob) or [`bob-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bob-bin) package with an AUR helper e.g. [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru): `paru -S bob`
2. Run it with `bob`

### Install from source

1. `cargo install --git https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob.git`
2. Run bob with `bob`

### Install from crates.io

1. `cargo install bob-nvim`
2. Run bob with `bob`

## ‚ùì Usage

A version-string can either be `vx.x.x` or `x.x.x` examples: `v0.6.1` and `0.6.0`

---

- `bob use |nightly|stable|latest|<version-string>|<commit-hash>|`

`--no-install` flag will prevent bob from auto invoking install command when using `use`

Switch to the specified version, by default will auto-invoke install command if the version is not installed already

---

- `bob install |nightly|stable|latest|<version-string>|<commit-hash>|`

Install the specified version, can also be used to update out-of-date nightly version.

---

- `bob sync`

If Config::sync_version_file_path is set, the version in that file will be parsed and installed.

---

- `bob uninstall |nightly|stable|latest|<version-string>|<commit-hash>|`

Uninstall the specified version.

---

- `bob rollback`

Rollback to an existing nightly rollback

---

- `bob erase`

Erase any change bob ever made including Neovim installation, Neovim version downloads and registry changes.

---

- `bob list`

List all installed and used versions.

---

- `bob complete bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh`

Generate shell completion.

---

## ‚öô Configuration

This section is a bit more advanced and thus the user will have to do the work himself since bob doesn't do that.

Bob's configuration file will have to be in `config_dir/bob/config.json` but can be customized as seen [below](#config-location), to be more specific:

<details>
<summary>On Linux</summary>

`/home/user/.config/bob/config.json`

</details>
<details>
<summary>On Windows</summary>

`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\bob\config.json`

</details>
<details>
<summary>On MacOS</summary>

`/Users/user/Library/Application Support/bob/config.json`

</details>

### Custom Location {#config-location}

Bob's config file location can be configured by using an environment variable called `$BOB_CONFIG`.
Example: `export BOB_CONFIG=/path/to/config/config.json`

}
```

## üíª Shell Completion

- Bash

Completion files are commonly stored in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` for system-wide commands, but can be stored in `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions` for user-specific commands. Run the command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
bob complete bash >> ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/bob
```

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

- Bash (macOS/Homebrew)

Homebrew stores bash completion files within the Homebrew directory. With the `bash-completion` brew formula installed, run the command:

```bash
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d
bob complete bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/bob.bash-completion
```

- Fish

Fish completion files are commonly stored in `$HOME/.config/fish/completions`. Run the command:

```fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
bob complete fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/bob.fish
```

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and log back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

- Zsh

Zsh completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in your `$fpath` variable. To use these completions, you must either add the generated script to one of those directories, or add your own to this list.

Adding a custom directory is often the safest bet if you are unsure of which directory to use. First create the directory; for this example we'll create a hidden directory inside our `$HOME` directory:

```zsh
mkdir ~/.zfunc
```

Then add the following lines to your `.zshrc` just before `compinit`:

```zsh
fpath+=~/.zfunc
```

Now you can install the completions script using the following command:

```zsh
bob complete zsh > ~/.zfunc/_bob
```

You must then either log out and log back in, or simply run

```zsh
exec zsh
```

for the new completions to take effect.

- PowerShell

The PowerShell completion scripts require PowerShell v5.0+ (which comes with Windows 10, but can be downloaded separately for windows 7 or 8.1).

First, check if a profile has already been set

```powershell
Test-Path $profile
```

If the above command returns `False` run the following

```powershell
New-Item -path $profile -type file -force
```

Now open the file provided by `$profile` (if you used the `New-Item` command it will be `${env:USERPROFILE}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

Next, we either save the completions file into our profile, or into a separate file and source it inside our profile. To save the completions into our profile simply use

```powershell
bob complete powershell >> ${env:USERPROFILE}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

`sudo: nvim: command not found`
This error can be caused when `secure_path` is enabled in `/etc/sudoers` like in distros such as Fedora Workstation 37, possible workarounds:

1. disable `secure_path`
2. run `sudo env "PATH=$PATH" nvim`
3. set `$SUDO_USER` to location of bob nvim binary: `SUDO_EDITOR='/home/user/.local/share/bob/nvim-bin/nvim`

These workarounds were devised by @nfejzic, thanks to him.
